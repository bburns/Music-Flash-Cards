# Music Flash Cards #

## About ##

A set of 10 music flash cards which can represent notes on any cleff from 2.5
ledger lines below and above the staff. 

Although no cleff is printed, this corresponds to actual note reading, where the
cleff is off to the left and out of sight.

The pdf fits 8.5x11" business card paper with 10 3.5x2" business cards, or just
plain cardstock or paper.


## Code ##

The pdf is generated from a LaTeX file which incorporates the individual images,
which were generated from Lilypond using a Ruby script.
